# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose

As many current employees reach retirement age, we are aiming to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Identifying the roles that require the most attention may ensure a smooth transition implementation for the management.  

## Results

- There are about 90,000 employees retiring. 
- Senior employees, naturally, make up the largest group among those reaching retirement age. 
- The ratio of *Senior Engineers and Senior Staff* to *Engineers and Staff* retiring is 2/1
- There is an imbalance of eligible for mentorship retiring employees across departments.

## Summary

Comparing the current workforce per title to retiring employees per title we can calculate the percentage of employees retiring per title. This way we can mark the specific roles that require special attention and careful planning.

The percentage of retiring Senior Engineers and Senior Staff is almost 30% of the current workforce. In the same category we find Technique Leaders with 4,502 out of 15,159 retiring which amounts to 29,7% . On the other hand, Engineers and Assistant Engineers are retiring at a far more reasonable rate of about 10% of current workforce. Engineers also make up the largest group of all titles. It is evident that the roles of Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, and Technique Leaders are the ones that need to be filled before the retirement wave is in effect. 

# Mentorship Availability
In terms of availability of qualified retirement ready mentors we understand, looking at the table that not only there is a massive wave of retiring employees from senior positions but there is also an insufficient number of mentors waiting to welcome the employees coming to mount these positions.

 While in departments like engineers, assistant engineers and staff the ratio of mentors to the total retiring from the departmemt is approximately 1 for 35, the ratio for Senior Engineers and Staff is 1 to 85. Technique Leader's ratio falls in the middle with approximately 1 eligible employee for every 60 retiring. This means the company has double trouble. First, the large numbers of Senior Employees and Technique leaders retiring and then the low number of eligible mentors who must undertake the task of guiding their replacements.  

## The Financial Aspect

Regarding financial qualities of this transition we see that the company's payroll is finely balanced. The average salary for all departments except Senior Staff, Staff and Management is just under the $50,000 mark. For the aforementioned departments average salary is closer to $60,000. 
A thousand Senior engineers and over over six thousand Senior Staff making over $70,000 are reaching the age of retirement. In the same salary average we find 400 retiring Engineers and almost two thousand staff. The company seems in a good position to get rid of some heavy contracts and negotiate lower ones with incoming employees.
