## Purpose

As many current employees reach retirement age, we are aiming to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Identifying the roles that require the most attention may ensure a smooth transition implementation for the management.  


## Summary

The percentage of retiring senior engineers and senior staff is almost 30% of the current workforce. In the same category we find Technique Leaders with 4502 out of 15159 retiring. On the other hand, Engineers and Assistant Engineers are retiring at a far more reasonable rate of about 10% of current workforce. Engineers also make up the largest group of all titles.
